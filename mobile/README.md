## API Integration

The mobile app communicates with the XENO backend via REST API.

### Authentication
Login to get JWT token:
```javascript
const response = await XENOAPI.login(email, password);
```

### Dashboard Data
```javascript
const dashboard = await XENOAPI.getDashboard();
```

### Send Email
```javascript
await XENOAPI.sendEmail(to, subject, body);
```

### Calendar Events
```javascript
const events = await XENOAPI.getCalendarEvents(7);
```

### Voice Commands
```javascript
const result = await XENOAPI.executeVoiceCommand(command);
```

## Push Notifications

### Setup
1. Firebase Cloud Messaging is configured in `App.js`
2. Token is automatically registered with backend
3. Notifications handled by `NotificationService.js`

### Testing Notifications
Send a test notification from Firebase Console or backend API.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect to Server
- Ensure XENO desktop app and API server are running
- Check firewall settings
- Verify server URL in settings
- Use your computer's local IP, not `localhost`

### Voice Recognition Not Working
- Grant microphone permissions
- Check device settings
- Ensure `react-native-voice` is properly installed

### Push Notifications Not Received
- Verify Firebase configuration
- Check notification permissions
- Ensure token is registered with backend
